                "The series chronicles the adventures of the title character and his various friends 
                in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. <br><br>Most characters are anthropomorphic sea creatures 
                based on real-life species. Many of the characters' designs originated in an 
                unpublished educational comic book titled The Intertidal Zone, which Hillenburg 
                created in 1989. <br><br>Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Pearl, and Squidward were the first other 
                characters Hillenburg created for the show. Many of their characteristics 
                were based on Hillenburg's experiences during his time at the Ocean Institute 
                or inspired by the traits of their species."*
